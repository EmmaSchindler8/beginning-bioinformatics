- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):
# AI Use Log (1st Use)
- Tool/model & version: Gemini in Google Colab
- What I asked for: When trying to practice the code for Task 6.1 (Hello, "Enter name"...) I got an error. It asked me if it wanted AI Gemini to
  explain the code and I agreed.
- Snippet of prompt(s):Please explain this error: (the error was an STR)
- What I changed before committing:Nothing changed, AI said it fixed the error. Maybe I am missing something but the error is still there?
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): Spoke with TA Adam/Dr. Demuth.
# AI Use Log (2nd Use) 
- Tool/model & version: Gemini
- What I asked for: When working on problem 3, I was doing the example (sum the odd numbers from 100-200). I was getting a syntax erorr and and "expected :" error, so I accepted Gemini's help to explain the error. 
- Snippet of prompt(s):
  Me: Please explain this error: "SyntaxError: Expected ':'"
  Gemini: The error in the selected code is a SyntaxError: expected ':'. This means that the for loop is missing the colon at the end of the line. I will fix this by adding a colon at the end of the for loop line and then add the code to sum the odd numbers within the loop.
- What I changed before committing: I added in the word "for" for loop and changed the order of how I mentioned only wanting to sum odd numbers. I did not copy and paste or just accept the changes, I made note of them and re-wrote them myself to better learn/practice. Some did auto-populate as I typed. For example, I did not know originally I needed this line (sum_of_odds +=numbers), but Gemini explained to me it was needed because it adds the actual numbers to the sum
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I used the test values from Rosalind (100, 200) and got the correct answer (7500).
